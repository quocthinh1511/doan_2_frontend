There're two ways to use this tool:

- As a normal website
- As a PWA

#### 1. Normal website

You can click or drag image file to the given area, and the tool will run automatically.

You can also `Ctrl+V` to paste the image you have just clip.

#### 2. PWA

There is a `install icon` in address bar and you can use it as a PWA. The language models are a bit large and will take some time. Just be patient :).

The new version will automatically check when connected to the Internet.

Use the same way as a normal website.
